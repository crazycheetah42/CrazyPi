# Crazy-Debian
crazycheetah42's Debian BSPWM customization, mostly based on ChrisTitusTech's Debian-titus project. This is the version I made for the Raspberry Pi because there are some programs in my original (like betterlockscreen) that wouldn't run, plus I wanted to make a lighter version for the pi.

```
git clone https://github.com/crazycheetah42/CrazyPi
cd CrazyPi
sudo ./install.sh
```
